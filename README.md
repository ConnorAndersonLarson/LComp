# LComp

Quick comp build for a code assignment in tandem with a job application. Comp utilizes HTML, CSS, and JS, no packages or other languages/frameworks are utilized. I utilized github to reflect my workflow and project management on this smaller scale, using project boards, issues, and pull requests to track my todos and progress. While the comp did not request this, the site is keyboard accessible, with each name focus-able via 'TAB'.

[Site is deployed here on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ConnorAndersonLarson/o6m7fgxj/1/)
